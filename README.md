This project is based on our paper "Complex structure-free compound-protein interaction prediction for mitigating activity cliff-induced discrepancies and integrated bioactivity learning". GGAP-CPI stands for **protein Graph and ligand Graph network with Attention Pooling for Compound-Protein Interaction prediction**.

## Introduction

Machine learning-based protein-ligand binding affinity prediction is crucial for drug virtual screening. **Structure-free Compound-Protein Interaction (CPI) prediction methods** leverage millions of bioassay measurements, offering greater flexibility than crystal structure-dependent methods. However, **activity cliffs**—minor chemical modifications leading to substantial bioactivity changes—pose significant challenges that are not well-explored in CPI prediction.

In this study, we present **CPI2M**, a large-scale CPI benchmark dataset containing approximately **2 million endpoints** across four activity types (Ki, Kd, EC50, and IC50), specifically annotated for activity cliff data. Additionally, we developed **GGAP-CPI**, a deep learning model that mitigates the impact of activity cliffs through protein feature fusion and activity type-based transfer learning.

Our evaluation across three simulated scenarios (general, unknown proteins, and transfer learning) shows that **GGAP-CPI outperforms 12 target-specific and 7 general CPI methods**, excelling in distinguishing bioactivity differences among activity cliff molecules. It also demonstrates comparable performance on **CASF-2016 and LIT-PCBA benchmarks**, highlighting its potential for practical virtual screening.

This study proposes effective strategies for investigating activity cliffs in CPI predictions, enhancing our understanding of structure-activity relationship discontinuities and aiding future CPI methodology development.

We also incorporate [**MoleculeACE**](https://github.com/molML/MoleculeACE) for activity cliff estimation, [**CASF-2016**](http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/casf.php) and [**LIT-PCBA**](https://drugdesign.unistra.fr/LIT-PCBA/) for virtual screening estimation. We have organized these datasets and all of them can be downloaded by:

## Model
![Model Architecture](https://github.com/gu-yaowen/Activity-cliff-prediction/blob/main/fig/model.jpg)

## Model training
Available training dataset includes: **CPI2M-main** (noted as 'ki', 'kd', 'ec50', 'ic50', 'integrated'), **MoleculeACE** ('MolACE_CPI_ki', 'MolACE_CPI_ec50'), and **PDBbind** ('PDBbind_all', only for reproducing GGAP-CPI-ft on CASF-2016).

Please run the following command for model training: 

```
sh run_bash/run_CPI.sh KANO_Prot {DATA_NAME} train {SEED}
```

parameters include: 1. training dataset; 2. mode (e.g., train); 3. random seed.

## Model Inference
We provide pretrained GGAP-CPI model on **CPI2M-main** dataset with different activity type predictor(GGAP-CPI-pKi, -pKd, -pEC50, -pIC50, and -pAC). We generally recommand you to use **GGAP-CPI-pKi**, **GGAP-CPI-pIC50** or **GGAP-CPI-pAC** (AC means pretrained on "integrated" activity data) for inferencing on your own data. 

Available inference dataset includes: **CPI2M-few** ('ki_last', 'kd_last', 'ec50_last', 'ic50_last'), **CASF-2016** ('PDBbind_CASF'), and **LIT-PCBA** ('UNIPROT_ID_LITPCBA').

Taking GGAP-CPI-pIC50 for example, please run the following command for model inference on MoleculeACE-pEC50 dataset:

```
sh run_bash/run_CPI.sh KANO_Prot MolACE_CPI_ec50 inference {SEED} ic50/2
```

parameters include: 1. inference dataset; 2. mode (e.g., inference, finetune); 3. random seed; 4. pretrained model path (only for KANO_Prot);

## Benchmark Results
The performances of GGAP-CPI and 19 baseline methods are evaluated on CPI2M-main, CPI2M-few, MoleculeACE, CASF-2016, and LIT-PCBA datasets. For your convience, 
we add the benchmarking result files for each of them in "benchmark_result" folder. \
Also, to reproduce results for GGAP-CPI, you can run the code:

Please note that there should be mild performance differences with different devices and package versions.

## Use Your Own Data
To train GGAP-CPI and other baseline models on your own **.CSV** data, which should at least include columns ['smiles', 'Uniprot_id', 'label']. Please run the following commands:
```
# preprocess data
python process_data.py --dataset {DATA} --task {CPI or QSAR} --split {random or ac} --train_ratio {RATIO} --seed {SEED}
# train
sh run_bash/run_CPI.sh {MODEL} {DATA_NAME} train {SEED}
# optional: finetune, inference, ...
```

GGAP-CPI is also applicable for classification tasks such as binder/nonbinder classification and drug-target interaction prediction. Please replace ```run_CPI.sh``` by ```run_CPI_cls.sh``` for model training and testing.
